## About Me
I'm a software engineer in Appleton, Wisconsin.  I could put something super self promoting here but I think the banner does that job for me.  I like solving problems and like to think deeper than just the code.  I've been an engineer for a while and still love it, I haven't spent my whole career sharing my work but I'll start now, hope whatever I put here helps you.

## Support Me
I'm sharing some of my work here and if it helps you, I'd love it if you'd consider supporting me.
