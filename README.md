## About Me
I'm a software engineer in Appleton, Wisconsin.  I could put something super self promoting here but I think the banner does that job for me.  I like solving problems and like to think deeper than just the code.  I've been an engineer for a while and still love it, I haven't spent my whole career sharing my work but I'll start now, hope whatever I put here helps you.

I'm a Data Scientist and Economist in San Francisco, CA. A little bit about me:

* Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics and Economics with 3+ years of experience in business intelligence, product growth, marketing strategy, customer journey analytics in various industries: e-commerce, consumer packaged goods, technology, education, and digital marketplaces

* My favorite languages besides English and Vietnamese: SQL, Python, R, and Tableau for data modeling, ETL automation, and dashboard development

* My favorite activities: A/B testing, experimentation design, causal inference, and machine learning (Linear & Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Means, NLP, Neural Network)

* What I do on the weekends: instagram.com/DobbyOnTheGo
